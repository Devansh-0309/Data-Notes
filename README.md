# 📒 Data Notes

Welcome to my personal collection of study notes! This repository contains handwritten and digital notes I've created while learning and revising various tech topics related to data and development.

These notes are not meant to be exhaustive guides—they're quick references and summaries I personally use to understand and revise concepts efficiently.
